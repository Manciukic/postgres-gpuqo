Musicbrainz is real world dataset (56 tables) that includes information about the music industry. 
We do not have access to query logs so we generate our own queries.

You can get MusicBrainz from : https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database
The NonPKFK.ipynb shows the MusicBrainz schema we use and query generation.
